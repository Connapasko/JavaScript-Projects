This application is a fully functioning timer that the user can interact with. 

Some of it's key features:

Allows user input to set any desired time to countdown from.
Timer countdown animation that dynamically syncs with timer countdown.
Start and Pause buttons.

This project was solved by using a and SVG element to draw a circle that is styled to have tranparent fill and a thick border.
The countdown animation is done by manipulating the stroke-dashoffset and -dasharry properties via javascript.

This project displays foundational knowledge of various HTML, CSS, and JS skills - It demontrates the design of a dymanic creation using event listeners, callbacks, etc - and also places an emphasis on the understanding of "this" and it's scope.
