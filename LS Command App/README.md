# File Listing Script

This is a simple Node.js script that lists all files and directories within a specified directory. It uses `fs` and `chalk` to display filenames in color, with directories highlighted in magenta and files in green.

## Features

- Lists all files and directories in a specified directory (or the current directory by default).
- Colors output to differentiate between files and directories:
  - **Files**: Green
  - **Directories**: Magenta
- Written in ES Modules (ESM) for compatibility with modern JavaScript syntax and libraries like `chalk`.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (version 14.x or higher)
- **npm** (Node Package Manager)

You can download and install Node.js from the [official website](https://nodejs.org/).
